			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<br>
			This is a sudoku puzzle task. The rules are standard sudoku. For those who are unfamiliar with the game the goal is to complete every row with the numbers 1-9, every column with the numbers 1-9 and every individual 3x3 grid with the numbers 1-9. The screenshots below show what the sudoku panel looks like. The puzzles start off with relatively few spaces required to fill but this increases as you complete more puzzles.

			<h3>The help feature</h3>
			<br>
			For every puzzle you try you can request help up to 5 times. The way in which the help function works is that whenever you press 'help on' then the sudoku panel will show you everywhere that the currently selected number can legally be placed at that moment. The screenshot below shows an example of someone requesting the help function for the number 5. It is important you remember to uncheck the 'help on' button to actually place your number. Every action you do while help is set to 'on' will use up one of your 5 allowed.

			Placing numbers in the grid is achieved by first selecting the number you want using the row of 1-9 buttons and then left-clicking on the square you want to put the number. To remove a number that you have misplaced you need to right-click on the number. when you think you have solved the puzzle you can use the 'check' button. If you have solved it then all the squares will flash green and you will move on to either a new puzzle or the end of the session. If you got some numbers wrong then they will turn red to show you where you went wrong so you can try and solve it.
