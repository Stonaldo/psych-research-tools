			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<h3>Presentation Phase</h3>
			<br>
			In this task you will be shown a number of mathematical questions that you must answer. In addition to answering the questions you must <span class='highlight_red'>remember the answer</span> so that you can provide this when prompted to recall them. <br>There will be <span class='highlight_red'>four</span> operations in each trial and they will look like the sum shown in the image below.

			<br>
			<br>
			The operations that you see will get more difficult as you get more correct answers. If your performance drops then the operations may become easier. You simply <span class='highlight_red'>press the number on the keyboard</span> that you think is the correct answer and the task will move on. When four operations have been answered the trial will move on to the <span class='highlight_red'>recall phase</span>. 
			<br>
			<h3>Recall Phase</h3>
			<br>
			When asked for your response you are presented with this screen:
			<br>
			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			You input your response by clicking the buttons that represent the number you want to input, <span class='highlight_red'>not</span> by pressing keys on the keyboard. The panel at the bottom of the screen will keep track of the response you have given (see image below). If you press the wrong button and want to make a change you can press the <span class='highlight_red'>reset</span> button and begin your input again. The trial moves on when you click on the final number in the response sequence (the 4th number).
