			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<br>
			This is the open recall task, it is different to the majority of the tasks in this battery in that you will be given more to try and remember per trial but you don't need to recall them in the correct order.
			<br>
			<br>
			You will be shown a list of words, one by one, in the center of the screen. After these words have been presented you will have 30 seconds to type as many of the words as you can remember. Type a word and press enter to submit it, then type the next and so on. The words you have submitted so far will be displayed on the screen.
