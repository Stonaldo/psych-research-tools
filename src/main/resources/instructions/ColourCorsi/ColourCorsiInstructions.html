			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<h3>Presentation Phase</h3>
			<br>
			You will see a 3x3 grid in the center of the screen that comprises <span class='highlight_red'>9</span> squares.
			The squares will begin to light up <span class='highlight_red'>(in a sequence)</span> and you will need to 
			remember the <span class='highlight_red'>order</span> in which they do so. However, when a square lights up 
			it may light up in one of <span class='highlight_red'>four different colours</span> and you must also remember 
			the colour of each square. The first image below shows you what the screen will look like during the <span class='highlight_red'>presentation</span> phase.		
			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			The number of squares that light up depends on the level you have reached. The level will <span class='highlight_red'>adjust</span> based on your performance, if you do well then it will increase, if you struggle then it will decrease. The level determines how many colour-location combinations are presented in a trial for you to recall. 
			<br>
			<h3>Recall Phase</h3>
			<br>
			When asked for your response you are presented with the 3x3 grid and also four boxes of different colours 
			at the bottom of the screen. To give your response you <span class='highlight_red'>first click the colour
			</span>that you think was presented <span class='highlight_red'>followed by</span> the grid you think changed 
			to this colour. You do this for as many squares as the level you are on. As you are entering your response there is a mini-grid for each serial position that will light up to match your response at each serial position.
